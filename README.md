# Print Statement Puzzle

Welcome to your first Python assignment! ðŸ‘‹

## Your Task

In the `src/assignment.py` file, you'll find a function called `spell_word()` that contains several print statements. Each print statement outputs a single letter. Your job is to rearrange these print statements to spell out a secret word.

### Rules
1. Don't change what each print statement says
2. Don't add or remove any print statements
3. Just change the order of the print statements
4. Don't change the function name or structure

### Example
If you had these print statements:
```python
def spell_word():
    print("T")
    print("A")
    print("C")
```
And you wanted to spell "CAT", you would rearrange them to:
```python
def spell_word():
    print("C")
    print("A")
    print("T")
```

## How to Complete This Assignment

1. Open the `src/assignment.py` file
2. Look at the letters in the print statements
3. Figure out what word they can spell
4. Rearrange the print statements to spell that word
5. Commit and push your changes
6. Check if your solution passes the tests (look for the green checkmark âœ…)

## Need Help?

If you're stuck or have questions:
1. Read the error messages if your code doesn't pass the tests
2. Ask for help during class
3. Check the Python documentation about print statements
4. Remember that the order of statements matters in Python - the code runs from top to bottom!

Good luck! ðŸš€
